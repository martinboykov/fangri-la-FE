  'Short: The lights, the energy, the moment. Nothing compares to feeling the crowd sing it back. 💫',
  'Medium: This is where it starts — the quiet moments before the chaos, where I ground myself and remember why I do this. Every note, every lyric, it’s all about pouring my truth into the music. The stage is next.',
  'Short: All love. All energy. All of you. ❤️',
  'Medium: There’s something sacred about being in the studio - experimenting with sounds, chasing that one harmony that gives you chills. This is where songs are born, where emotions take shape, and where the world outside fades until the music is all that matters.',
  'Short: Finding clarity in golden hours. 🌅',
  'Medium: You can’t fake joy like this. Music is serious, the grind is real, but I always come back to laughter. It fuels me, heals me, and keeps me grounded when life tries to make me forget who I am.',
  'Short: Transformation mode: ON. 💄✨',
  'Medium: I grew up with city sounds -  trains, sirens, late-night conversations on stoops. That rhythm has always been in me. Walking these streets, I’m reminded of where I came from, and how every song I write is rooted in that heartbeat.',
  'Short: Lost in the spotlight. Found in the music. 🎶',
  'Medium: Music isn’t always bright lights and big crowds. Sometimes it’s raw, vulnerable, and painted in shades of shadow. I’ve learned to embrace that side of me, because it’s real - and real is the only thing worth singing.',
  'Short: All eyes, all lights. ✨',
  'Medium: Backstage rituals. The calm before the chaos, the sparkle before the storm. Every detail matters before stepping out there.',
  'Medium: Some stages are arenas, others are quiet corners. This is where the stories start - before they ever find a beat.',
  'Short: Concrete truths.',
  'Medium: Streets change, faces pass, but the rhythm of the city keeps me grounded. Every step writes another line in my story.',
  'Medium: When the mic is on, the world fades. It’s just me, my voice, and a thousand feelings searching for the right words.',
  'Short: Found my frequency.',
  'Short: No walls, no distance.',
  'Medium: This is the roar, the shine, the moment you dream about when nobody’s watching. And I’m living it.',
  'Short: Edge in every glance.',

    'They doubted every move, laughed at every setback, counted me out every chance they had. Now I’m pushing foreigns, still hungry like day one. Success don’t change the grind, it just raises the stakes.',
    'This energy? Can’t buy it. Can’t fake it. It’s love.',
    'Not every day is bright, not every story is easy to tell. But the booth don’t judge - it listens. I step in here with gratitude, knowing my voice can change someone else’s darkest day. That’s the real blessing.',

    'Every pair got a story. Every grind got a reward.',

<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Marrow</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a slow bleed - lush, cinematic, and unflinching in its honesty. Nyla Veil explores rebirth, heartbreak, and the body&rsquo;s memory through layered harmonies and orchestral soul. Each Virtual Vinyl&trade; includes </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Beneath the Feathers&rdquo;</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &mdash; an NFC-enabled digital short that blends motion portraiture and spoken word, allowing fans to hear unreleased verses woven into the soundscape as Nyla&rsquo;s voice guides them through a dreamlike narrative.</span></p>
